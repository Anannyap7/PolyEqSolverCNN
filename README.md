# PolyEqSolverCNN
Made a Handwritten Polynomial Equation Solver using CNN as a group project (Lakshya Gupta, Anannya Popat, Abhimanyu Verma)

The architecture of the model used is given below:

Worked and modified `ARPIT JHUNJHUNWALA`'s work wherein he used SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for the same problem. A higher training/testing accuracy was achieved.
